Pi private cloud projekt
Tutorial: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/build-your-own-cloud-storage-with-raspberry-pi-and-bittorrent-sync/
### Plan:
  - Objective: Private cloud storage with access from the internet
  - Why important: Security, Scalability, Costs, cross-platform
  - Milestones: storage solution for multiple devices via
    1. terminal
    2. GUI
    3. Website
  - Biggest obstacles: static IP-Address only with paid providers
  - Personal interest: Aquire knowledge in: networking, file-system
  - How much time: 2 hours per week.

## Steps:

Install raspberry PI OS on SD-Card. (SD card adapter required)

### Enable remote access (local network)
  - Enable SSH connection via shell: `$ raspi-config` -> interfaceing options -> enable ssh
(from here localhost-network has access to PI, mouse, keyboard & screen not required anymore)
  - Check ip address: ifconfig
  - Connect from other device: `$ ssh <username>@<ip-address>` (password and user from OS installation)

### Access from internet (outside localhost)

only temporary solution: ngrok generate new address every time it is restarted.

Install ngrok (to expose PI port to internet)
  - Upgrade apt (package manager): `$ sudo apt upgrade`
  - Install snap-store (other package manager): `$ sudo apt install snapd`
  - Install ngrok: `$ sudo snap install ngrok` (follow ngrok website installation)
  - Expose port port to internet: `$ ngrok tcp <PORT>` (e.g. port 22)
  - Copy address from blue box shown in picture below:

  - Connect from outside localhost: `$ ssh <username>@0.tcp.ngrok.io -p <PORT>` (<Use>)

                                                                                      
use public IPv4-address : (Find via https://www.whatismyip.com/)

### Mount USB-Drive (or any other drive)
- Create partitions as described here: [Creating Partitions in Linux](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-create-partition)
  - Dont forget to format partition via: ´$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1´ into desired type (ext4)

- List disk names: `$ sudo fdisk -l`
- Mount drive via: `$ sudo mount -t auto /dev/sda1 /media/sync` to a specific folder (in this case our cloud-sync folder)
  
### File-Syncronization: [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/downloads/)
  
## LOG
05.05.22: 
  - Created and mounted USB partitions using `$ fdisk` command 
  - Added Syncthing for file syncronization between mutliple devices (currently only localy accessible)
